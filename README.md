## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- body-parser
- cookie-parser ( changed later into cookie-session because cookie-parser is a middleware which parses                        cookies attached to the client request object)
- cookie-session (Cookie session is basically used for lightweight session applications where the session                     data is stored in a cookie but within the client [browser], whereas, Express Session                        stores just a mere session identifier within a cookie in the client end, whilst storing                     the session data entirely on the server )

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.
